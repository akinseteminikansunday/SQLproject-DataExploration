    DATA EXPLORATION WITH SQL

In this project, I analyze a movie data set using SQL on GoogleBigquery where I explore the dataset to get various insights. I used SQL to sort, filter, and aggregate the data set while I used Excel for visualization.

GOAL OF THE PROJECT:

The goal of the project is to identify different patterns in movie genres released by year and analyze each movie genre according to the revenue generated, budget, and the number of movies released according to genre. The questions aimed to be answered are:

1. Which movie genre has the most movies?
2. Which movie genre generated the most revenue?
3. Which year is the most movie released?
4. Which movie director has the highest number of movie direct?
5. Which movie genre has the most budget?

 After getting insights into the above questions, I created a dashboard using Excel to visualize my findings.
